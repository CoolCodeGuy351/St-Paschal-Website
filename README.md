3/30 : Website structure and content mostly complete on index.html. Still needs styling.

  TODO: - Finish Structuring sections and text within section. 
        - Need to build borders / boxes to seperate content in Mass times and Upcoming events sections.
        - Narrow down which buttons / pages to include  / exclude from website. 
        - Build last section which contains links / extra buttons. 
        - Build additional website pages / content.
        - Finish styling website including theme.
